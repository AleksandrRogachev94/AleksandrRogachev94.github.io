<p>Hi everyone! My name is Alex. Welcome to my blog! I'm a web developer with a passion for learning and implementing exciting ideas. I obtained Bachelor Degree in Physics from MSU and worked as a scientific assistant. I was always close to programming and it was part of my job in a scientific group. Eventually I decided to dedicate my life to programming. I enrolled to Flatiron School and finished it to get missing knowledge in web development. Now I'm working at Ursa Tech as a Software Engineer and really enjoy it!</p>
