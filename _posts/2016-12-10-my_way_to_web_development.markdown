During my whole life, my passion was versatile technical subjects: physics, math, and programming. When I was a child, I loved building and launching aero models with internal combustion engines. 

While I was studying at school, I already had my first real programming project: development of speech recognition system based on neural networks. It was coded in C++. I was a winner of several physics and math Olympiads, so I received a grant for the education in Moscow State University.

I have just graduated from the top university in Russia, Moscow State University (department of physics). It is 27-th in world ranking by subject, physics.

When I was studying at the university, I was working in an outstanding scientific group in photonics and ultrasensitive magnetic sensors fields. Our results were published in several scientific journals. For example, you can find our paper in Applied Physics Letters, famous American scientific journal:

The main part of my job was numerical simulation of physical processes. I used C++ to do that. Eventually, I found that I love coding and want to bind my life with it. That is why I decided to start my career as a software developer. I am looking forward to learning different aspects and branches of it in the future.

I have enrolled to Flatiron programming school and truly enjoying my education process. I’ll do my best to become a great developer in corporate world. I’m eager to apply my formal education as well as my experience and ideas to my future professional journey.
